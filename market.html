            Hello, all beings, I'm Marketa. And you?
            I'm a graphic artist, and I've had art at heart for many years. 
            Unfortunately, that wasn't enough, and I found myself in programming. 
            My "first" was Java, and as first love, it will remain so. 
            Javascript is definitely more free, but also more chaotic for me. However, 
            I do have my pages in it, but I didn't make them myself at the time. 
            Er... all I can say about myself is that I don't want to do graphics or anything visual makes me slightly nauseous. 
            I'm excited to see clear results, as opposed to art.
            I have a cat (alive), a unicorn on a shelf (sculpture, not alive unfortunately), 
            drink a lot of coffee, make them spicy, and watch weird movies (Lynch, Adam's Apples, Star Wars , but also homicides, etc). I think I have a lot of ideas. I'm not above beer or wine, 
            and I'd like to program for the future. The only thing I don't have is time. 
            I work full time, and I also do externally graphics. I still feel like a horrible LAMA.
            Live long and prosper!
