          <h2>About Jana</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I am Jana and I would like to confess. At the very beginning I was
            really struggling with flex-boxes and <em>JavaScript</em> during my
            Czechitas Academy. It was something completely different from what I
            had been doing for last few years. To be honest with you, it
            reminded me of the times I was struggling with Arabic at the uni.
            But after some weeks it started to be a good fit. The creativity is
            what appeals to me. And I fell in love with JavaScript…Well, at
            least, you know…
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking about our project, I watched some youtube tutorials about
            glass morphism style and animation so we could apply them on
            Hradějov sites. I mean, I really like these styles but of course I
            do have on my mind its main target group of customers. So we will
            see.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we can’t forget the contract owners and their vision, right?
            They are my former co-workers from the ethnological department from
            Masaryk University. Roman Doušek wrote those playbooks slash games
            (they are still at a graphic designer, by the way). And my awesome
            colleague Marie Novotná who has their business under her thumb.
            Hopefully it will be a win-win. They gave us text materials and
            illustrations for the sites and web app and will get amazing
            websites for free. And we don't have to fabricate original texts and
            at the same time can use it as an opportunity to deep our knowledge
            of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
