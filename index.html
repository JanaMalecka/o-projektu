          <h2>Site about our project</h2>
          <p class="text">
            You are reading our website about our final project created for
            Czechitas Digital Academy: Web. Once it is complete it will appear
            on domain https://hradejov.cz.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be a promotional website about playbooks with funny little
            fairy tale figures called Utrhčíslo, Puzzolente and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being very optimistic it will have a functional e-shop for selling
            these fabulous playbooks along with a game programmed in JavaScript.
            To be more specific, it should be a game teaser for start. Fingers
            crossed. And then, hopefully very soon, the entire version of this
            game (as a web app) about Utrhčíslo will appear on this site as
            well.

            Our site and it’s design should be appealing especially to children
            from four to ten years and their parents, grandparents, teachers,
            and carers. Simply to everyone who wants to explore Brno with little
            kids.
